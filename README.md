# GameEngine

Game Engine is an open-source, modular game engine framework built for modern interactive experiences. The engine delivers a full suite of core functionalities—including rendering, physics, sound, scripting, animation, AI, networking, and more—while providing two distinct analytical approaches to suit different development needs.

## Overview

This project features two variants:

- **Complex Analytical Methods:**  
  Utilizes advanced mathematical models and predictive algorithms to simulate high-fidelity, computationally intensive scenarios. Ideal for developers seeking deep analytical insights and enhanced simulation precision.

- **Real Analytical Methods:**  
  Focuses on direct, physics-based, real-time analysis. This mode prioritizes practical performance and resource efficiency, perfect for applications requiring immediate, physically-grounded feedback.

## Core Features

- **Rendering Engine:**  
  Supports both 2D graphics to bring your game world to life.

- **Physics & Collision Detection:**  
  Robust physics simulation with precise collision detection and response.

- **Scripting & Animation:**  
  Flexible scripting system to define game logic alongside dynamic animation capabilities for characters and objects.

- **Artificial Intelligence:**  
  Built-in AI modules that provide NPC behavior, decision-making, and pathfinding.

- **Asset Streaming & Memory Management:**  
  Efficiently load/unload assets on the fly while optimizing resource usage.

- **Threading:**  
  Supports multithreading for performance.

- **Scene Graph & Cinematics:**  
  Organize game objects effectively and integrate video support for immersive cinematics.
